# Chinese Longitudinal Mockup: A Reference Overview

This project centers on the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) Biomarkers Datasets collected in 2009, 2012, and 2014 (ICPSR 37226). The goal is to provide a structured mockup environment for analyzing longitudinal health data related to aging and longevity among the Chinese elderly population.

## Motivation

Longitudinal health data on aging populations is critical for understanding the biological and environmental factors influencing longevity and healthspan. The CLHLS dataset offers rich biomarker information collected over multiple waves, enabling analyses of trends and predictors of health outcomes in an aging demographic.

This repository was created to facilitate exploratory data analysis and modeling using these datasets, providing a foundation for biostatistical investigations.

## Problem Addressed

Handling and analyzing longitudinal biomarker data requires careful data management, preprocessing, and statistical modeling. This project addresses these needs by organizing the data, supplying documentation and literature references, and demonstrating a logistic regression model to predict health outcomes.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Organization:** The repository includes raw data files, manifests, and user guides to ensure proper understanding and usage of the datasets.

- **Literature Integration:** Related literature files provide citations to published and unpublished works that analyze or critique the CLHLS data, supporting contextual understanding.

- **Modeling Example:** A logistic regression model is implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook markdown file. This example demonstrates importing data, preprocessing, and applying logistic regression to model health predictors.

- **Tech Stack:** The analysis leverages Python data science libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning. The Google BigQuery client and contextily are included for potential data querying and geospatial visualization.

- **Reproducibility:** Instructions for environment setup and running the notebooks are provided to ensure reproducibility.

## Practical Considerations

- The logistic regression example serves as a template for modeling health outcomes but can be extended to other statistical or machine learning methods.

- Data files and user guides are included to reduce barriers to entry for new users.

- The project structure is designed for clarity and ease of navigation, separating raw data, documentation, and analysis scripts.

- Future work includes expanding the scope of analyses and automating data processing.

## Summary

This mockup project provides a practical foundation for working with the CLHLS biomarker datasets. It is intended as a technical reference for developers and researchers returning to this work, emphasizing data handling, modeling, and reproducibility without extraneous commentary or motivational language.
