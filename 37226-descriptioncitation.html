		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) biomarkers datasets were collected by the Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies (CHADS) of National School of Development at Peking University and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The datasets are compromised of the in-depth studies conducted in 8 longevity areas in the CLHLS' 5th, 6th and 7th waves in 2009, 2012 and 2014, respectively. During these studies, China CDC local network medical doctors conducted physical examinations of the participants and collected 7,334 samples from the centenarians, the oldest-old aged 90-99 and other younger age groups. The biomarkers datasets contain about 30 indicators on routine blood/urine tests and blood biochemical tests. The demographic variables in this collection include age and sex.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> All data files in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) can be linked using a key variable called ID., Additional information about the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey as well as study design can be found at the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/centerforaging/programs/chinese-longitudinal-healthy-longevity-survey-clhls/">Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development</a> website.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> <p>The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS) collected biomarker data from participants in the in-depth studies of the longevity areas in order to study the health conditions of different age groups and their determinants and confront the challenge of population aging.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> Face-to-face interviews were conducted using the same questionnaires used in the other study sites of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) local network medical doctors conducted physical examinations of the participants. The doctors also collected blood samples and urine samples from centenarians, the oldest-old aged 80-99 and other younger age groups.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>All centenarians from the 8 longevity areas in China who agreed to participate in the study were interviewed.</p>
<p>The 8 longevity areas are as follows:</p>
<p><ul><li>Laizhou of Shandong Province</li>
<li>Xiayi of Henan Province</li>
<li>Zhongxiang of Hubei Province</li>
<li>Mayang of Hunan Province</li>
<li>Sanshui of Guangdong Province</li>
<li>Yongfu of Guangxi Autonomous Region</li>
<li>Chengmai of Hainan Province</li>
<li>Rudong of Jiangsu Province</li></ul></p>
<p>For each centenarian, one octogenarian aged 80-89 living nearby, one nearby nonagenarian aged 90-99, and one nearby younger elder aged 65-79 of predesignated age and sex were interviewed.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> The most elderly population in the 8 longevity areas in China during 2009 through 2014.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> medical records, survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> computer-assisted self interview (CASI), coded on-site observation, cognitive assessment test, face-to-face interview</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> 97.7 percent</span></p>
